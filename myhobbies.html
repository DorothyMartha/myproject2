  <p>I love marketing</p>
  <p>Marketing is the action of promoting products or services</p>
    <p>This includes market research and advertising.</p>
    <p>The reason I love doing this is because I personally love interacting with people</p>
    <p>I also love the whole idea of someone getting informed about something when I'm the source</p>
    <p>I have worked with several companies and currently working for wave mobile money</p>
    <P>The following are the things we do while marketing;
        <li>Approach a customer</li>
        <li>pitch to the customer about what the service is offerring</li>
        <li>If the customer gets interested you go on and sign them up on the service</li>
